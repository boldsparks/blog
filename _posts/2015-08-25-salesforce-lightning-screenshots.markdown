Salesforce have announced the availability of Salesforce Lightning.

**What have they announced?**

A new user interface for the desktop version of Salesforce which is called Salesforce Lightning. This will be available for Sales Cloud at first, but also Salesforce's other apps in future releases. It will be generally available in the Winter '16 release of Salesforce - which ships in about a months time - just after Dreamforce '15. Switch on will be at customers own pace and it will be possible to enable at a user, profile or organization level.

This is not just an interface change - Salesforce are changing the technology used for their desktop application to be the same as used on their mobile app: Salesforce1.

**What does it look like?**

Here is an extensive collection of screenshots of the new interface from the coverage today:

**Salesforce Lightning Homepage**

The new homepage: gone are the horizontal tabs and the old sidebar. Now we have a vertical sidebar with only icons instead of words.

However the sidebar does expand to show the names of each section.
