The Lightning Process Builder is now active in Salesforce Spring '15 sandboxes - the early release instances were activated this weekend.

>The Process Builder is a new workflow tool that helps you easily automate your business processes by providing a powerful and user-friendly visual representation of your process as you build it. The Process Builderâ€™s simple and powerful design allows you to:

> * Create your processes using a convenient visual layout with point-and-click efficiency.
* Create your whole process in one place rather than using multiple workflow rules.
* Have multiple colleagues contribute to creating your business processes.
* Stop using Apex code to automate simple tasks.

It is time to review its functionality and see how suitable it is to replace existing workflow rules, existing code and new developments.
