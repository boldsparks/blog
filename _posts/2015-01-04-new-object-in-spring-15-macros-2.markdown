In the Spring '15 pre-release orgs there is a new object called Macros. At the moment it seems like a fairly normal standard object with the exception of the UI on the page layout:

![Macro Page Layout](/content/images/2015/01/macros-layout-1.png)

At present you can click to add "Macro Instructions" but you can't pick anything from the picklist and when you save nothing happens.

Given how limited the fields on this object are it is difficult to know what its intented purpose is. However I would guess this will be used as part of the Service Cloud to allow for groupings of automated tasks. 

This has currently got the object prefix: 0JZ.
